# Covariant formulation

Electrodynamics can also be expressed in a covarinat formulaltion. In this case the objects of interest would be 4-vectors and tensors.
This package provides a convenience function for computing [the electromagnetic tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_tensor) ``F`` from the corresponding electric and magnetic fields for a given laser type.
